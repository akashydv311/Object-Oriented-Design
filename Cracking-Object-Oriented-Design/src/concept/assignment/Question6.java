// coupling?
/*
  Coupling is a concept in software engineering that describes the degree of interconnectedness or dependency between different modules or components in a software system. It refers to how closely one module or component relies on another. Low coupling is generally considered a desirable characteristic in software design because it leads to more maintainable, flexible, and reusable code.
 
 
 * There are different types of coupling:
 
 Tight Coupling (High Coupling): In tightly coupled systems, components are highly dependent on each other. Changes in one component often require changes in others. This makes the system less flexible and more difficult to maintain. Tight coupling can lead to a lack of modularity and code that is challenging to understand and modify.

Loose Coupling (Low Coupling): In loosely coupled systems, components are more independent and have minimal dependencies on each other. Changes in one component do not necessitate changes in others. This makes the system more flexible, modular, and easier to maintain and extend.


Low coupling is typically favored in software design because it promotes the following benefits:

1. Ease of Maintenance  2. Ease of Testing  3. Flexibility  4. Reusability  5. Understanding
